*** when viewing a solution, make sure to see all solutions as they are not necessarily listed in optimal order. Also I don't always put all solutions at the header, sometimes you may need to scroll down to see if there are more ***

# Guide to Documentation

Copy and paste these into the solution files:

- Any tags (e.g. tags: none)
- State the Solution/Attempt no.
- State the time and space complexity
- If there is a another solution, include that and specify the time and space complexity as well.
